## Introduction
This projects aims to be a ressource for the [Refold Discord Servers](https://refold.la/join/). Some people spend countless hours logging their immersion time, immersion streaks and anki streaks. This terminal-based utility aims to create an easy to use way to automate this process.

As well as simplifying the process of logging, this tool gamifies the process of language learning by tracking your statistics as well as giving you a score for all of your hard work and time put into language learning.

## Features

* ‚è∞ Automatic immersion tracking and formatting with Toggl Track
* ‚≠ê Integration with Anki to keep track of total reviews, retention rate, and mature cards !
* üî¢ Compatibility with Default Anki Retention and TrueRetention 
* ü§ñ Server "automatic" mode and manual mode
* ü§ì Compatibility with [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)

## Installation

### Windows guidelines
It is recommended to close your browser during the setup process. While fetching your toggl track token, there may be accessibility conflicts within the cookies database.

### MacOS guidelines
You will be required to authorize APL access to your screen. This is used to track the synchronisation process with anki.
If you're on MacOS 15 Sequoia or later, you will need to revalidate this every month.

### Linux guidelines
Most of the automagic connections will not work on linux or will only work on very few distros.

## Configuration

#### What's the difference between manual and server modes?
Manual mode will create a new report every time you ask it to. It will generate one report and then close itself. This is useful when you are running the logger on your own home computer.
Server mode will create a new report at a specified interval at a certain time. This is useful when you are running the logger on a home server.

The decision you make is not final and it is very easy to change between the two in the settings.

#### Getting your toggl Track token
Your API key is available at the bottom of [your profile page](https://track.toggl.com/profile)

#### Anki database path

According to the [anki documentation](https://docs.ankiweb.net/files.html#:~:text=On%20Windows%2C%20the%20latest%20Anki,Anki%20in%20your%20Documents%20folder)
```
On Windows, the latest Anki versions store your Anki files in your appdata folder. 
You can access it by opening the file manager, and typing %APPDATA%\Anki2 in the location field. 
Older versions of Anki stored your Anki files in a folder called Anki in your Documents folder.

On Mac computers, recent Anki versions store all their files in the ~/Library/Application Support/Anki2 folder. 
The Library folder is hidden by default, but can be revealed in Finder by holding down the option key while clicking on the Go menu. 
If you're on an older Anki version, your Anki files will be in your Documents/Anki folder.

On Linux, recent Anki versions store your data in ~/.local/share/Anki2, or $XDG_DATA_HOME/Anki2 if you have set a custom data path. 
Older versions of Anki stored your files in ~/Documents/Anki or ~/Anki.
```
The database file will usually be named 'collection.anki2' 

#### Anki app path
This is where your anki app is stored. 

On Windows, you can find it by searching for the app in the windows search menu, right-clicking on the app and pressing "open file location" repeat this until you have the anki.exe app. This is the app path. 

On MacOS, you can find it by searching for the app in spotlight search and pressing `‚åò` + `Enter`. This will highlight the app.

On Linux, figure it out lol idk ü§∑

Once you provide this path, anki will launch. Once launched, the configuration script will ask you which one of many processes is anki. Find the process that most closely matches the anki process and enter the corresponding number.

#### 
## Limitations
This has only been tested on Windows and MacOS, if you have issues on other operating systems, skill issue lmao.

This app will only work on computers with a graphical desktop environment, meaning you cannot run this on a CLI-only server.
