/**
 * @module uploadRoute (apl-storage)
 *
 * ## üì§ Upload User Picture
 *
 * This route handles saving a user‚Äôs profile picture to the local file system.
 * It expects a multipart/form-data body containing a single file field named `file`.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ### üß† Responsibility
 * - This route is intended to be used by `apl-server` as a reverse proxy.
 * - The actual file gets stored **physically** on disk, NOT in the database.
 * - Auth should NOT be handled here ‚Äî access must be managed by `apl-server`.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ### üìÅ Where does it save the picture?
 * The picture is saved in:
 * ```
 * ./public/pictures/{userId}.png
 * ```
 * Where `userId` is the UUID passed in the URL.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ### üì• Example request
 * ```
 * POST /upload/abc-123
 * Content-Type: multipart/form-data
 * Body: { file: <File> }
 * ```
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ### ‚úÖ Behavior
 * 1. Ensures `public/pictures` exists (creates it if necessary)
 * 2. Writes file contents as a PNG using the user‚Äôs UUID as filename
 * 3. Responds with a success message
